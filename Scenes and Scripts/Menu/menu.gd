#Create an animation that when the player hits "play", the buttons will be burned down using particles 
#to simulate fire. 
#When the player hit quit, the game will make a sound of fire beeing watered
#When the player hit loads the furnace door behind the buttons will appear and the buttons will vanish
#I can scale down until they are not visible
